                        A stalker dog is one that would appear on DogLine. People would interview them
                        to see what they were thinking when they committed their horrible offenses to
                        humans and other dogs but more specifically.... CATS! Oh, the poor cats that
                        have "disappearing" in your neighborhood.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="about">How do you know you have a stalker dog?</h2>
                    <p>Most would not put two and two together as they don't think much about it
                        like all great masterminds your stalker dog is great at covering up their hence
                        act.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>At first, you might notice your dog following you everywhere being all sweet
                            and innocent... a little too innocent!
                        </li>
                        <li>After that, your dog will start to test your response time by doing
                            something bad to see how you will respond as well as how long it will take.
                        </li>
                        <li>Next, the cat population in your neighborhood might have gone down greatly
                            over the last couple weeks of your dog either coming to adulthood or of you
                            owning your adult dog.</li>
                        <li>Finally, any dogs you get while that one is still alive will randomly go
                            missing. Never to be seen again until a few weeks later when ASPCA picks them up
                            off the side of the road... DEAD!</li>
